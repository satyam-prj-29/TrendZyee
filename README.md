Title: TrendZyee

Introduction:
TrendZyee is an e-commerce shopping website where users can easily access branded shoes, clothes, and heels all in one place. The platform provides a seamless and convenient shopping experience for users looking for premium fashion items, ensuring they find the best brands in a user-friendly environment.


Objective:
The project was developed with the goal of creating a centralized platform where people can access branded fashion items effortlessly. Instead of browsing multiple sites, TrendZyee offers a curated collection of high-quality products, allowing users to shop with ease.


Proposed Method:
To develop TrendZyee, I used modern web development tools and technologies. The front-end was built using Vite, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a responsive and interactive user experience. The back-end functionality was developed using Node.js to handle server requests and manage the database of products and users. Together, these tools create a fast, efficient, and reliable shopping platform.


Tools and Technology:
Development Tools: Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
Frameworks and Libraries: Vite, Node.js
Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
